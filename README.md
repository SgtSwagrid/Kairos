## 🎯 The problem

You have `m` candidate options — venues, each free at particular times, each holding
a limited number of people at some cost — and `n` people you would like to be there.
You know everything about the venues and nothing about the people.

You could ask everyone to mark their availability across a year. They will not do it,
and if they do, the answers will be wrong. You could name a date and ask whether it
works, but naming a date is not free: people start holding it, booking flights around
it, and taking offence when it moves.

So: **which few questions, put to which few people, would most improve the choice?**

Kairos answers that, one round at a time, and tells you when to stop asking and book.

## 🧭 How it works

1. **Enumerate the options.** Every placement of the event that a venue can actually
   host. This is the step that makes the rest tractable: typically a few dozen
   candidates rather than 365 days.
2. **Ask a little.** Questions are chosen to tell us as much as possible about *which
   option is best*, per unit of what they cost to ask. Broad questions ("could you
   travel somewhere in June?") come before named dates, because naming a date is dear.
3. **Model the rest.** Answers become a probability that each person attends each
   option. Thousands of simulated turnouts give the chance that each option is in fact
   the best one, and the risk of overrunning a venue.
4. **Stop when asking stops paying.** Kairos reports what perfect knowledge of
   everybody's diary would be worth, in guests. Once that falls below the cost of
   another round, book.

### What it does in practice

Against a simulated guest list whose availability is hidden from it — 29 candidate
options across 3 venues, 32 guests, each favouring one month of the summer:

| Round | Questions | Broad | Named dates | Leading option | Confidence | Value of information | True rank |
|------:|----------:|------:|------------:|----------------|-----------:|---------------------:|----------:|
| 1 | 40 | 39 | 1 | Lauterbrunnen, 28 May | 11% | 10.22 | #29 of 29 |
| 2 | 40 | 36 | 4 | Lauterbrunnen, 21 May | 9% | 11.34 | #13 |
| 3 | 40 | 20 | 20 | Scheidegg Hut, 2 Jul | 22% | 7.39 | #7 |
| 4 | 40 | 11 | 29 | **Scheidegg Hut, 9 Jul** | 28% | 6.04 | **#1** |
| 5 | 40 | 1 | 39 | Scheidegg Hut, 9 Jul | 51% | 3.18 | #1 |

Four rounds of about one and a quarter questions per guest find the best of 29
options. Note the shape of it: the early rounds buy broad questions and settle the
month, and only then does it start naming dates.

Setting the cost of naming a date to zero makes it *worse*, not better — it wanders
between months for six rounds and ends at rank #3. Screening first is not merely
polite; it is the more efficient use of a round.

Note also that the value of information rises between rounds 1 and 2. This is not a
defect. Learning that many guests are free in July widens the gap between the options,
so what it would cost to choose wrongly can grow before it shrinks.

## 🔬 What this is, formally

The problem sits at the intersection of several well-studied ones, and the
implementation borrows from each:

| Aspect | Problem class |
|---|---|
| Choosing questions to identify the best *decision*, not to learn everyone's diary | Decision-region determination; Bayesian experimental design |
| Broad questions whose negative answers rule out many options at once | Pooled group testing |
| Graded answers over candidate dates, elicited incrementally | Incremental preference elicitation with minimax regret |
| Knowing when to stop | Expected value of perfect information |
| Attendance against a venue's capacity | Poisson-binomial tail; stochastic knapsack |
| Choosing a whole round at once, in few rounds | Batched/low-adaptivity observation selection |

Two implementation notes worth reading if you intend to change the solver, both
recorded at length in [`Elicitation.scala`](common/src/main/scala/solve/Elicitation.scala):

- **Questions are scored by mutual information, not by expected improvement in the
  choice.** Scoring by improvement was tried and fails badly: one person's answer
  seldom overturns which option leads, and where it does not, the improvement is not
  small but *exactly zero*. Among thirty guests most questions then score nothing,
  the search cannot rank them, and rounds stop a few questions in.
- **Mutual information is not submodular within a participant.** Answers can be
  complementary — "could you travel in May?" and "could you travel in June?" are worth
  more together than apart — so the second question to someone may score higher than
  the first, and the greedy selection carries no approximation guarantee. It is still
  the standard and sensible choice; the breadth of a round is governed by the
  questions-per-guest limit rather than by the objective's shape.

## ⚖️ Settings that matter

Set on each poll, and adjustable from the dashboard:

- **Cost of naming a date** (default `3`) — how much dearer it is to ask about a named
  date than about a whole period. This is the setting that decides whether dates get
  named early. At `1` they always will.
- **Chance any date suits** (default `0.5`) — what to assume before anyone answers.
  Lower it when attending is a real imposition, as for long-haul travel; the worked
  example uses `0.25`.
- **Penalty per guest over capacity** (default `3`) — should exceed `1`, since turning
  away a guest who has accepted costs more than never inviting them.
- **Guests worth one unit of cost** (default `0`) — leave at zero to ignore price and
  choose purely on attendance.

## 🚧 Requirements

- **[Scala 3](https://www.scala-lang.org/)** — fetched by sbt; installing it separately is optional.
- **[sbt 2.0](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)** — the build tool.
- **[JDK 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)** — the runtime.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** — for version control.

## ⬇️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SgtSwagrid/kairos.git
cd kairos
```

## 💻 Local development

### Run a local development server
```bash
sbt dev
```
- Hot-reload is enabled: the server and client restart when code changes.
- Available at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Click "Create a worked example".
- API documentation at [localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs).

### Compile all subprojects
```bash
sbt build
```

### Run the tests
```bash
sbt "common/testOnly -- *"
```
- Includes an end-to-end simulation that hides a guest list's availability from the
  solver and checks that a few short rounds find a near-best option.

### Format all code according to style rules
```bash
sbt lint
```

## ⚙️ Environment variables

- `HOST` — the address the server listens on (default: `localhost`).
- `PORT` — the port the server listens on (default: `8080`).
- `DATA_FILE` — where polls are mirrored to disk (default: `data/polls.json`, anchored
  to the project root in development). Set to `none` to keep them in memory alone.
- `GH_TOKEN` — a GitHub personal access token, used by CI and agentic workflows.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Three subprojects, as laid out by
[Scala Website Template](https://github.com/SgtSwagrid/scala-website-template).

### [`common`](./common)

Cross-compiled to both the JVM and JavaScript. Holds the entire domain model and the
whole solver, which therefore has no dependency on the server and could equally be run
in the browser.

- [`model`](common/src/main/scala/model) — days, windows, options, participants,
  questions and graded answers. [`Day`](common/src/main/scala/model/Day.scala)
  implements civil-date arithmetic directly rather than depending on `java.time`,
  which has no Scala.js implementation.
- [`solve`](common/src/main/scala/solve) — the pipeline, in order:
  [`Belief`](common/src/main/scala/solve/Belief.scala) turns answers into
  probabilities, [`Ensemble`](common/src/main/scala/solve/Ensemble.scala) samples
  possible turnouts from them,
  [`Forecast`](common/src/main/scala/solve/Forecast.scala) computes each option's
  exact attendance distribution,
  [`Verdict`](common/src/main/scala/solve/Verdict.scala) reads the advice off the
  ensemble, and [`Elicitation`](common/src/main/scala/solve/Elicitation.scala) decides
  what to ask next. [`Analysis`](common/src/main/scala/solve/Analysis.scala) is the
  single entry point.

### [`server`](./server)

A JVM backend serving both the API and the pages, using
[Tapir](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/) on [Netty](https://netty.io/). Polls are held
in memory and mirrored to a JSON file.

### [`client`](./client)

Transpiled to JavaScript and rendered with [Laminar](https://laminar.dev/). Three
views: the landing page, the organiser's dashboard, and the page on which one
participant answers their questions. A participant's page carries nothing about the
poll beyond their own questions — not the guest list, not the weightings, not which
dates are winning.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Participants are modelled as independent.** Households who travel together are
  recorded but not correlated, which understates the variance in turnout. A
  participant's own answers *are* correlated across options.
- **Answers are assumed honest and stable.** There is no model of people who say yes
  to everything, nor of availability changing as the date approaches.
- **No authentication.** Anyone with a participant's link can answer as them, and
  anyone with a poll's link can see the dashboard. Fine among friends; not fine
  otherwise.
- **Polls are mirrored to a file, not a database.** Adequate for a handful of polls
  amended a few dozen times; not for concurrent use at scale.
