  * asking whether the slot it settles on is in fact a good one.
  *
  * This is the claim the whole design rests on: that a handful of rounds, each
  * asking each participant only one or two questions, suffices to identify a
  * near-best slot out of many. Everything else is only machinery.
  *
  * Every claim here is made across several hidden guest lists rather than one.
  * A single list flatters or damns the solver by luck — quality at three rounds
  * ranges from 71% to 100% of the best available across the lists below — so an
  * assertion tuned to one of them says nothing about the method.
